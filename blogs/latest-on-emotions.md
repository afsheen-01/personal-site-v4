# Latest on emotions

The personal life side of the whirlwind referred to in [navigating latest storm](../navigating-latest-storm/).

- Feeling guilty for mishandling a romantic situation while trying to do be right. To have been optimistic about what something could be despite the challenges I was aware of:

  - Lack of efforts to make something out of it
  - Knowing that I am not the only one
  - Knowing that I neither was nor would be important
    Pursuing it invites more harm not 'cause we’re bad people but data suggests otherwise. I don’t understand how these pheromones and this tension works. Currently, they seem to not care for data.

- To not give into the overstimulation by reminiscing past, anxiety of the future and distress all immediate problems. Categorise immediate problems into solvable and insolvable, focus on the former. Learn to let go of the rest. Always be truthful and honest to myself. Not always brutally but in a way that when things get rough, I stabilize myself. And when things are good, I am able to gratefully accept it with grace and dignity. And when things are neither bad nor good, that's okay too. Lack of action means more opportunity to focus. Sit with it instead of stirring a pot with distress and dopamine. This is the time to activate eustress.

- Modify emotional coping mechanism. I’d bottle up emotions for a prolonged period of time until every small thing starts affecting me. When it does, I blow up everything in the vicinity until all the negativity’s out. By the time I realise the problems, the damage’s done. A better way to deal with this would be to communicate better about how I am feeling. To listen to my mind and body when they say they’re tired or exhausted and a break’s imperative. I promise myself to not take breaks with excess baggage. To not work with excess baggage. If it doesn’t fit and/or it doesn’t help me grow, it’s out of my bag/sight/mind.

- Emotions rise and fall like a wave. Be it anger, fear, anxiety or any other, it’ll reach it’s peak and then only come down with time. But the world doesn’t stop moving in that time and I need to be able to work with it instead of against it. Also, every wave feels like a tsunami and so long as I am aware, it’s completely okay because I can deal with it.

- Emotions are always going to be a mixed bag. Very rarely do we get to experience them in their purest form. The idea of mixed bag is not at all wrong or incorrect even if they’re contradictory. Purity ≠ Perfection.
