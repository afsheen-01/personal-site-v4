# The hard conversation

_{{ date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}_

Whatever advices you have for your close ones, please hear it out once and implement for yourself as well. For a companionship to work, both people have to feel the same way and you can't change how someone feels. Your state of excitement makes you child like and that’s okay. You can work on regulating it with time, awareness and focus. It's okay to want more time, attention, efforts and investment from the ones you want to be with. Do right by yourself going forward before you want to do right by others.

Stop with the negative talks and villianising yourself in every situation. Just because you don’t want to play the victim doesn’t mean you’ve to play the problem by default as well. Let love happen at it’s own time and space, don’t get too excited and rush into anything. **Fulfill your potential to YOUR satisfaction first. Only then add more variables to it.** You must not go back down this road again without caution. Prioritise better - your well being, family’s well being, friends and then systems.

I cannot stress this enough, you chose to start earlier than everyone else but you can’t go back now. Stick to it, stick to the role you’ve to play in your life and others. Let’s grow with grace and dignity. You’re a born fighter, fight the urge to not show up, your irrational monkey and the intrusive noise that says you can’t. Fight the urge to to throw it all away, escape doesn’t fix the problem, it delays it and worsens it. Don't let anyone or anything come between you and your goals.

Remember, this city is staging for you. This is where you shape yourself to become capable of handling both pressure and money well. Move onto the markets and the ideal work places you want to be at. Consistently chase excellence, your dreams and dopamine - the right way. Be competitive, compassionate, empathetic, whatever you want to be. Put yourself out there. Do not get dejected and put yourself in a nutshell. Do not shrink yourself under the disguise of protection from harm. Harm is inevitable - however it might be, whatever it might be. You can and you will take the best decision for yourself despite the intrusive thoughts. Cast them aside and do the best you can for yourself.

Do the hard thing, despite the toughness, risk and lack of protection involved. Less judgements and opinions, more actions. When you're worried about the legs shaking while squatting, you do more of it. You push your knees outwards, feet slightly outwards and keep your torso upright. You keep doing it, again and again to get better. Don't get worried about the squats, keep observing and keep executing it over and over again.
