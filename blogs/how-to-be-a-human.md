# How to be a human - a novice's edition

Hello world, I am Afsheen - a woman in her mid-twenties. I like to ask a plethora of questions to understand my experiences and the world around me. The range of experiences are much like the ever-expanding space, where change is the only constant.

I’ve usually just suppressed and ignored emotions, but when the turmoil gets overwhelming, I write. I’ve had my fair share of battles both thrown by life and taken up by myself - mostly taken up by myself. But to cope, you resort to the most basic, fundamental forms of connection and understanding of human nature - read, write, talk to other people i.e. communicate.

Over the years, I’ve developed a system for my battles (which is a forever WIP). It always gives me a new set of parameters for decision-making, improving my system a little bit at a time. In an attempt to make sense of the things I’ve understood so far and to structure my thoughts better, I present to you “How to be a human - a novice’s edition”. Hopefully, since it’s blaugust month, where we celebrate writing for the entire month by trying to write and publish as much as we can, I’ll be able build good momentum🤞
