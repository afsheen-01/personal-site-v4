# Summarising the lookback

Thanks to the theme of blaugust, I went through all my journals both phyiscal and digital. I cried, cringed and laughed. I smiled for how inconsequential the situations were which made me feel so much and so deep. Here's a compilation of all the thoughts that I've repeated to myself over the years. These are mostly intrusive thoughts I keep giving into, again and again due to setbacks.

- Accountability for new ventures is very important to ensure progress no matter.
- If current tools at your disposal don’t work and slow you down , restart. No matter how much time you’ve spent on them.
- Things could still go faster. _Occurrence in journal 3_.
- Get back on the track one step at a time.
- I’ll figure it out. _Occurrence in journal 4_.
- Don’t try to punch above your weight unprepared.
- Focus on work, career and family. _Occurrence in journal 4_.
- Prioritise better, don’t put others before your needs and goals. _Occurrence in journal 3_.
- Don't be fearful. _Occurrence in journal 5_.
- Find dopamine outside work.
- Emotions are friends. They are not meant to harm you.
- Always question the intention behind the guilt.
- Compartmentalise better. _Occurrence in journal 2_.
- Set high standards but leave room for mistakes.
- Expectation management. _Occurrence in journal 3_.
- Don’t downplay and negate yourself. _Occurrence in journal 2_.
- Over-organising, over-planning and overthinking is a bane to problem solving. Gives false sense of progress with over-complication. _Occurrence in journal 7_.
- Chasing speed and perfection at the same time on day 0 is not the best way to operate. It’s ideal in your head, sure but all good things take time.
- When you’re tired, take a break.
- Calm down. _Occurrence in journal 7_.
- Ease in, be okay with failure. Recoup energy and start again. _Occurrence in journal 2_.
- When things do start happening or moving in the right direction, don’t let go of the habits that get you there.
- Don’t run away from all your problems and your home. Face it, manage it, live with it instead of finding ways to survive.
- Delays are okay, going slow is okay, don’t get complacent with it.
- Communicate without fear. _Occurrence in journal 2_.
- Just sit with it! _Occurrence in journal 2_.
- Overwhelmed. I need distraction management system. _Occurrence in journal 6_.
- Life doesn’t have to have some deeper meaning or higher purpose. It just has to be.
- It’s the age of attention economy and ADHD is prevalent.

I would also like to mention that the experiences I’ve had in these 4 years were much interesting and happy as well. Since I only used to journal when I was at my lowest, the compilation doesn’t offer a holistic picture of my life. Regardless, A promise made will be a promise kept. With that, Bidding adieu to these journals.

**Closing Note**: I feel too much, too deep and too often and that's okay.
